The goal of this project is to create an algorithm to predict the number of bikes needed on a given day. In order to achieve it, a Neural Network is created. 

## Table of Contents 
The following jupyter notebooks are provided:
[1. Data Preparation and model creation](https://github.com/titoniubo/bike_rentals/blob/master/1.%20Data%20preparation%20and%20Model%20Creation.ipynb)
[2. Data Visualizations](https://github.com/titoniubo/bike_rentals/blob/master/2.%20Data%20Visualizations.ipynb)


It is specially interesting to see how data the weather conditions may affect bike rental trends
